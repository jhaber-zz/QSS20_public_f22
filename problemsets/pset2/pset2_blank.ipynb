This analysis could be extended to study Hispanic defendants or, in a different jurisdiction, Asian and other minoritized groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, this dataset reports the sentence given to defendants convicted of different crimes, and you can find [the data codebook here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/views/tg8v-tm6u/files/8597cdda-f7e1-44d1-b0ce-0a4e43f8c980?download=true&filename=CCSAO%20Data%20Glossary.pdf) and the latest on these data [at the official website](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details if interested in digging deeper** (optional): There is a lot to think about here in terms of (1) how we might measure disparities, and (2) what factors you would want to adjust for when deciding whether two defendants are 'similarly situated' but for their race. You can read more technical coverage in the following sources:\n",

    "\n",
    "**One major caveat**: when comparing whether two similar defendants received different sentences, we're missing one important attribute that influences sentencing: the defendant's criminal history. This influences sentencing both through sentencing guidelines, which can prescribe longer sentences for those who have certain types of prior convictions, and through judicial discretion if judges are more lenient with first-time defendants. The above sources discuss how much we want to \"control away\" for this prior history, since if we think there are racial biases in which defendants, conditional on *committing* a crime, are arrested and charged, we may not want to adjust for that factor."
